    Bro - the basic structure is  : First the file /hackernewsindia/public/index.html  - this file opens and there is an ID - root
    which is then replaced by all the code and all the necessary scripts are imported in the <scripts> tag in the index file you can
    check it out
    
    After the file index.html gets loaded then all the backend java script gets called .

    so the file /hackernewsindia/src/index.js loads --> this is the main parent JS file that loads. and from here on we can
    create as many components we want. In this case App.js is one of the component. so we can trasnfer the control from here to anywhere 
    from here.
    
    #one very important fact that i learned from so much trial and error - always name the component with a Capital First Letter
    
    The folder API usually has an API file which consists all the api's that we will hit in the backend
